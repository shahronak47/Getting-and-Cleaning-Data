# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

All the codes are saved in the run_analysis.R file. If you need to run the file, make sure that you already have all the tables (x_test, y_test, subject_test etc) pre-loaded in the R environment. All other instructions specific to codes are mentioned as comments in run_analysis.R file.

I haven't changed the variable names. Hence, they are still the same as they were in features.txt. 

Codebook has the details of all the variables used.  

run_analysis.R has the script used to perform the tidy data. 

final.txt contains the final output of the program.
